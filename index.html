      <h1>​Play On!</h1>
      <p>​LACHS makes games for a modern age. With our world increasingly
      making use of modern technology, LACHS embraces the notion that today's
      children will learn with computers. To ensure no child gets left behind,
      we bring our games to the internet, accessible across countless
      platforms. With cheaper technology solutions on the rise, this number can
      only grow. We hope kids everywhere have fun learning with LACHS!</p>

  	  <div class="founder">
  		<img class="recommendationImage"  src="assets/founder1.png">
  		<h2>Haswell Brookes-Lachs</h2>
  		<p>Haswell is the company's original founder. After having previously worked as an ambasssador for GitHub, he decided to expand his passion for teaching in a way that would reach children everywhere. Building web games was the best way to make this both accessible and modern.</p>

  		<h2>Lemmy Lachs</h2>
  		<p>Lemmy works primarily on the site's backend, having gained strong experience in this area through many years of working at DigitalOcean. While his work on spinning up hundreds of servers for clients across the world was a far bigger role than the one he takes here, he's still diligent in making sure the site is always available.</p>

  		<h2>Preis Fisher</h2>
  		<p>Preis manages LACHS' communications with both customers and companies. He is responsible for the promotion of LACHS games as learning tools, seeking support with our hosting and domain providers, and research. Were it not for Preis, LACHS would not be among some of the strongest tech startups out there!</p>

        <h1>LACHS partners with GitHub!</h1>
        <p>Version control is a necessity to all programmers - it's a vital part of their education, just like those basic things children learn in primary schools. GitHub knows just how important it is to teach a good workflow and make sure everyone's on the same page, so we have partnered with them to employ a new line of ambassadors for our games!</p>
        <p>Expect to see LACHS at a school near you very soon as we demonstrate our games to youngsters across the UK, provide fun tutorials, and show them that education can be fun with the magic of modern technology. GitHub's mentors are also very excited to work with us, and have released their own official statement on the matter, from the mouth of their very own little Octocat, Mona Lisa.</p>
        <blockquote>
          "I can't wait to show you all what LACHS have in store!"
        </blockquote>
        <p>"Learning can be tough, but this website makes it super fun," the Octocat has said as the mascot of her company in announcing our partnership. "I can't wait to show you all what LACHS have in store!"</p>
        <p>GitHub are often present at hackathons across the UK and US, so they're much more used to working with university students. We can assure you, however, that they've all been fully trained to engage the interest of primary school children in our official LACHS-approved tutorial programme.</p>
        <p>Perhaps LACHS will visit your child's school very soon? Watch this space for an official list of schools we'll be visiting.</p>

        <img src="assets/slide.png" alt="Sliding Block Puzzle">
        <h1>LACHS releases its first game!</h1>
        <p>LACHS is proud to release our first game - a sliding block puzzle! Slide each piece into place to match the given image. It's random each time, so have fun trying to create not one, not two, but a possible 362,880 different pictures! And better yet, if you're struggling, just hit the reshuffle button for a new puzzle and a new starting point.</p>
        <p>Read on for the technicalities...and if you don't know what that word means, perhaps you've got a little more learning to do. Either way, LACHS looks forward to helping as many children on their learning journeys as possible!</p>
        <blockquote>
          "It was tough, but we've finally done it."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Haswell worked for a straight day to put this game out. It is the culmination of Javascript experience he has picked up over the past several weeks, a language he chose for its extensive compatibility with all kinds of inputs and browsers. The game is fully playable on touchscreens and PCs alike, allowing it to reach children everywhere, no matter their device.</p>
        <p>We're all very excited to have put this game out for everyone. As Brookes-Lachs proclaimed after a much-needed cup of tea, "It was tough, but we've finally done it." Enjoy the game, and await the next ones!</p>
