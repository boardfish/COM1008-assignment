            LACHS partners with GitHub!
          </h1>

          <p>
            Version control is a necessity to all programmers - it's a vital
            part of their education, just like those basic things children
            learn in primary schools. GitHub knows just how important it is to
            teach a good workflow and make sure everyone's on the same page, so
            we have partnered with them to employ a new line of ambassadors for
            our games!
          </p>

          <p>
            Expect to see LACHS at a school near you very soon as we
            demonstrate our games to youngsters across the UK, provide fun
            tutorials, and show them that education can be fun with the magic
            of modern technology. GitHub's mentors are also very excited to
            work with us, and have released their own official statement on the
            matter, from the mouth of their very own little Octocat, Mona Lisa.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <!--Acts as trigger for "Show Full" button to be displayed. Anything
          beyond this point in the article is hidden.-->
            "I can't wait to show you all what LACHS have in store!"
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            "Learning can be tough, but this website makes it super fun," the
            Octocat has said as the mascot of her company in announcing our
            partnership. "I can't wait to show you all what LACHS have in
            store!"
          </p>

          <p>
            GitHub are often present at hackathons across the UK and US, so
            they're much more used to working with university students. We can
            assure you, however, that they've all been fully trained to engage
            the interest of primary school children in our official
            LACHS-approved tutorial programme.

            Haswell worked for a straight day to put this game out. It is the
            culmination of Javascript experience he has picked up over the past
            several weeks, a language he chose for its extensive compatibility
            with all kinds of inputs and browsers. The game is fully playable
            on touchscreens and PCs alike, allowing it to reach children
            everywhere, no matter their device.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're all very excited to have put this game out for everyone. As
            Brookes-Lachs proclaimed after a much-needed cup of tea, "It was

        <h2>
          Club Penguin
        </h2>

        <p>
          In March 2005, the founders of Club Penguin set out to create an
          ad-free, virtual world where children could play games, have fun, and
          interact.
        </p>

        <p>
          As internet specialists and parents, they wanted Club Penguin to be a
          place they'd feel comfortable letting their own children and
          grandchildren visit.
        </p>

        <p>
          After months of consultation, research and testing, Club Penguin
          opened to the public in October 2005. Thanks to great reviews from
          players and parents, word quickly spread. In March 2006, Club Penguin
          launched on Miniclip, the world's largest online game site, and
          rapidly became its number one game.
        </p>

        <p>
          In August 2007, Club Penguin joined the Walt Disney Company in a
          partnership designed to provide access to unprecedented resources and
          unique development opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Less than a year later, in April 2008, Club Penguin opened its first
          international office in Brighton, England, in order to provide
          localised player support and moderation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Club Penguin is privileged to be part of the Walt Disney Company,
          which shares its unwavering commitment to creating a fun and safe
          online entertainment experience for children and families.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Club Penguin we believe everyone deserves a place to live, good
          health, an education and hope for a bright future. We're passionate
          about community engagement and we work hard to foster a culture of
          giving, both in the virtual world of Club Penguin and within our
          company.
        </p>

        <p>
          Club Penguin is headquartered in the beautiful city of Kelowna,
          British Columbia, Canada and maintains offices and staff in São
          Paulo, Brazil; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.

          The site was launched on 15th November 1999. Neopets has been

          Moshi Monsters
        </h2>

        <p>
          Moshi Monsters is an online game for kids, where they can adopt and
          take care of a friendly monster. It’s free to play, but we also offer
          a paid Moshi Membership that gives players access to a host of
          exclusive extra features.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within the game there are many fun, educational activities for kids
          to enjoy, such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Playing games and solving puzzles to earn virtual rewards, called
          "Rox"
          </li>

          <li>Growing and collecting pet ‘Moshlings’ in their garden
          </li>

          <li>Socialising with friends and family
          </li>

          <li>Reading the latest Moshi news and entering competitions on The
          Daily Growl blog
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, many parents (and grandparents) have so much fun helping to
          look after their children's monster that they adopt their own Moshi
          Monster. In addition, we sell cool Moshi Monsters merchandise that
          make great presents for the Monster Owners in your family. Visit the
